# enter the development environment
# (this will automatically download and install quartus,
#  so expect it to take a while the first time)
# you will also need to install usb blaster udev rules:
#   https://gist.github.com/gmarkall/6f0a1c16476e8e0a9026

# clone the repo and cd into it

nix develop --extra-experimental-features 'nix-command flakes' --profile profiles/dev -L -j4
cd src

mkdir images
wget https://github.com/litex-hub/linux-on-litex-vexriscv/files/8331338/linux_2022_03_23.zip
unzip -d images linux_2022_03_23.zip

# load the core template onto the pocket and start it so you see
# a dark gray screen. plug the usb blaster into the jtag port

# compile the design and program the fpga sram
python3 linux.py --build --load

# open a terminal over jtag and upload the boot software, kernel, and rootfs
# this will take quite some time to upload...
litex_term --jtag-config pocket_term.cfg jtag --images=images/boot.json
